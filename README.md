# Spring boot with jsf example
Just a simple project to experiment with the combination of jsf and spring boot.

I used this [tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-jsf-applications-with-spring-boot/) as a starting point. 
The code originated from their [repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/spring-boot-faces), I have just tweaked it a little.
